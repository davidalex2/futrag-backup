MVC Pattern: An Extremely Simple Overview

MVC pattern: It is a very robust, widely-applied software architectural pattern for splitting an application into three interdependent components: MVC pattern. And what this may offer developers as a chance is to build maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications.

Parts of the MVC Pattern
Model: This is the graphical representation of the data and business logic of an application. In the model, data management, calculations, and enforcement of business rules are performed. The Model involves the responsibility of storing and retrieving data in a database or other data storage systems.
View: This is the application's user interface. It pulls information from the Model and presents it to the user. This allows him to understand it easily. The view can appear as a web page, a mobile phone's screen of an application, or a desktop computer's window of an application.
The control accepts input from the user and, then, interfaces with the model to carry out business logic operations. Then it updates the view. In that respect, the control accepts user inputs validates their data and manages the workflow of any application.
How the MVC pattern works

Below is a technical explanation of the way MVC pattern works.

User Interaction: The user will interact with the application-at least in this test case, by making some request, such as filling out a form or clicking a button.
The controller receives a request from the user and determines what to execute.
The Controller will interact with the Model to carry out business logic, such as retrieval of data or updating the database.
Model Executes Business Logic: Does some required business logic-it may be computation or validation of some data.
Model Return: It sends this information to the controller and then returns back.
View: The controller provides feedback to the View with the data that it receives from the Model.
View - View will render the UI with updated data.
The Advantage of the MVC Pattern

The MVC pattern has many good benefits:

Separation of Concerns: MVC pattern is a very simple and effective way of separating the logic of an application into three distinct components, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.
Reusability: the design enables code and components to be reused in other parts of the application.
Flexibility: This enables a developer to replace different views, models or controllers quite easily without any effect on the remainder of the application.
Scalability: With MVC, application developers will be able to scale the applications that support and process requests from many users who make several requests.
Real-life Applications of MVC Pattern

MVC patterns are used in every kind of application.

Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP .NET MVC: The kind of pattern that most of the web applications make wide use of.

Mobile Apps: it is implemented in the mobile applications and comes under the applications of iOS and Android. Desktop Applications: The MVC pattern can be adopted in such desktop applications as Windows and macOS applications. Conclusion. MVC can be basically understood as architectural pattern that breaks down the application into three interdependent parts, namely, Model, View, and Controller. It provides advantages like separation of concerns, reusability, flexibility, and scalability. MVC can be used quite extensively in web and mobile applications, however, it can be applied to any desktop application.
